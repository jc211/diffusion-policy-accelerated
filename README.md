# Diffusion Policy Accelerated

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/diffusion-policy-accelerated.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/diffusion-policy-accelerated)

Diffusion Policy Accelerated is a library that showcases the use of custom CUDA extensions and CUDA graphs to accelerate the inference of DiffusionPolicy-C. It's primary purpose is to serve as a pedagogical tool for those interested in writing custom GPU kernels to improve model inference performance. Refer to [this](https://www.vrushankdes.ai/diffusion-inference-optimization) blog post series for more info. 

## Installation

To install Diffusion Policy Accelerated, make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can install PyTorch by following the instructions on the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

Once PyTorch is installed, you can install Diffusion Policy Accelerated using pip:

pip install diffusion-policy-accelerated
